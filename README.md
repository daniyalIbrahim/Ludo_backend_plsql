# THE LUDO GAME

This project consists of implementation of the board game ludo. I used Oracle PL/SQL for writing this script.


#### Files

    - Procedures.sql
    - Tables.sql
    
    
Run the tables.sql script at the first place. this would initialize the tables of oracle database. 
Later on, the procedures.sql script can be executed to add logic on the tables.
